# social-network-api

API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friends list. This app uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM, and the Moment.js package to format time. At the command line, type `npm i` to install the dependencies, then `npm start` to start the server. All routes were tested using Insomnia.

The walkthrough video below demonstrates the functionality of this app.
